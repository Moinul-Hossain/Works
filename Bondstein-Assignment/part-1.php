<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>
A <dfn>constant</dfn> is a value that cannot be altered by the program during normal execution, i.e., the value is constant. In versions prior to PHP 8.0, it was possible to define case-insensitive constants by passing true as third parameter of the function. Then it was possible to redeclare define, when it was previously defined as case_insensitive constant (3rd parameter). For example, in PHP 5.x,

</p>
<p>
But, case-insensitive constants is no longer supported in PHP 8 and in PHP 7.3 and 7.4, the ability to define case-insensitive constants is deprecated.
